        "Okay, here's a 7-day beginner workout plan focusing on overall fitness since the user specified \"None leg_muscle\" and \"exercise None\" which implies a focus *away* from legs and a general starting point. This plan prioritizes building a foundation of strength and endurance, suitable for someone new to exercise.  Remember to consult a doctor before starting any new workout routine.",
        "**Important Considerations for Beginners:**",
        "*   **Warm-up:** Begin each workout with 5-10 minutes of light cardio (e.g., brisk walking, marching in place, arm circles) and dynamic stretching (e.g., arm swings, leg swings, torso twists).",
        "*   **Cool-down:** End each workout with 5-10 minutes of static stretching, holding each stretch for 20-30 seconds. Focus on major muscle groups worked that day.",
        "*   **Listen to your body:** Don't push yourself too hard, especially when starting out. It's okay to modify exercises or take breaks when needed. Pain is a signal to stop.",
        "*   **Proper form:** Prioritize correct form over the number of repetitions. Watch videos or ask a trainer for guidance if you're unsure about proper form.",
        "*   **Rest:** Rest and recovery are crucial for muscle growth and preventing injury. Ensure you are getting adequate sleep (7-9 hours) each night.",
        "*   **Progression:** As you get stronger, gradually increase the number of repetitions, sets, or resistance (e.g., using heavier dumbbells).",
        "**7-Day Beginner Workout Plan:**",

            "content": "The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of your neck, just below your Adam's apple. It's a vital part of your endocrine system, which is responsible for producing hormones that regulate many bodily functions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its key aspects:\n\n*   **Function:** The thyroid's main job is to produce thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones are crucial for regulating your metabolism, which is the process your body uses to convert food into energy. They affect nearly every organ in your body, including your heart, brain, muscles, and digestive system.\n*   **Regulation:** The thyroid's activity is controlled by the pituitary gland, located in the brain. The pituitary gland releases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which tells the thyroid to produce T4 and T3.\n*   **Importance:** Thyroid hormones are essential for:\n\n    *   **Metabolism:** Controlling how your body uses energy.\n    *   **Growth and Development:** Especially important in children and during pregnancy.\n    *   **Heart Rate and Blood Pressure:** Helping to regulate these functions.\n    *   **Body Temperature:** Contributing to maintaining a stable body temperature.\n    *   **Weight:** Influencing how your body burns calories.\n    *   **Mood and Energy Levels:** Affecting mental and physical well-being.\n\n*   **Thyroid Disorders:** Problems with the thyroid can lead to various disorders, including:\n\n    *   **Hypothyroidism:** Underactive thyroid (not producing enough hormones). Symptoms can include fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and depression.\n    *   **Hyperthyroidism:** Overactive thyroid (producing too many hormones). Symptoms can include weight loss, rapid heartbeat, anxiety, and tremors.\n    *   **Goiter:** Enlargement of the thyroid gland.\n    *   **Thyroid Nodules:** Lumps in the thyroid gland.\n    *   **Thyroid Cancer:** Cancerous growth in the thyroid gland.\n\n*   **Diagnosis and Treatment:** Thyroid disorders are typically diagnosed through blood tests that measure TSH, T4, and T3 levels. Treatment options vary depending on the specific disorder and may include medication, radioactive iodine therapy, or surgery.\n\nIf you suspect you have a thyroid problem, it's essential to consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice.
