        "Okay, here's a 7-day beginner workout plan focused on increasing bicep size, keeping in mind it's a beginner program and needs to be safe and effective.  It prioritizes proper form and progressive overload (gradually increasing weight or reps). Remember to consult your doctor before starting any new workout routine.",
        "**Important Considerations for Beginners:**",
